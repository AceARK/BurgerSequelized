# Burger App
--------------
## Eat-da-Burger Restaurant app using MVC design

Allows users to input any kind of burger and display it on the left with a random burger icon for each of the burgers.

A 'Devour it!' button will transfer the associated burger to the right panel marking it as Devoured with a crumpled wrapper next to it, to signify that it's been eaten.

### Cool features

* UI that looks remarkably like a burger website, featuring a juicy burger in the background.
* Tiny burger icons for each of the yet-to-be-devoured burgers created by user.
* Tiny wrapper icons for all the devoured burgers.
* 'Ordered at' and 'Devoured at' time formatted to match client browser timezone.
* Cool addictive raised buttons.
* Responsive design.
* Null or invalid values redirects user to error page.
