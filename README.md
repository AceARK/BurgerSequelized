# BurgerSequelized

## Eat-da-Burger Restaurant app using MVC design and Sequelize ORM

Users can - 
* View all burgers and their details (owned by, devoured by, created at, devoured at).
* View all customers.
* Add themselves as customer.
* Visit customer page to create (or devour) their burgers.

### Cool features

* UI fitting a burger website.
* Tiny burger icons for each of the yet-to-be-devoured burgers created by user, and tiny wrapper icons for all the devoured burgers.
* 'Ordered at' and 'Devoured at' time formatted to match client browser timezone.
* New customers can add themselves to the growing list of customers (and displayed as buttons on homepage).
* Clicking on each customer takes them to customer page where new burgers can be created and exiting ones eaten.
* Input validation via sequelize for null and invalid values, redirecting user to error page.
